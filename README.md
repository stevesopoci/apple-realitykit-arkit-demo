# ar-spiderman-filters

`ARSpiderManFilters` is a native **iOS** augmented reality prototype written in **Swift** that demonstrates face tracking with **RealityKit** by anchoring 3D masks of Spider Man, Venom, and Vulture to the users face. Upon successfully anchoring a mask, users are given instructions on how to interact with Spider Man's robot spider and the Vulture's wings.
