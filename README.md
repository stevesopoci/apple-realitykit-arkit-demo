# apple-realitykit-arkit-demo

`AppleRealityKitARKitDemo` is a native **iOS** augmented reality prototype written in **Swift** intended for learning purposes that demonstrates Apple's powerful frameworks like [ARKit](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/arkit/) and [RealityKit](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/realitykit/), and creative tools like [Reality Composer](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/tools/) and [Reality Converter](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/tools/).

[RealityKit](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/realitykit/) gives you more control and customization over the AR experiences you create with native **Swift** APIs and [ARKit](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/arkit/) integration. With additional APIs like Custom Rendering, Metal Shaders, and Post Processing, you have more control over the rendering pipeline and more flexibility to create entirely new worlds in AR. And with the [Object Capture API](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/object-capture/), you can create unique 3D objects that are optimized for AR in minutes using state-of-the-art photogrammetry algorithms.

[Reality Composer](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/tools) is a powerful tool that makes it easy for you to create interactive augmented reality experiences with no prior 3D experience. [Reality Converter](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/tools/) quickly converts your existing 3D models to USDZ so it works seamlessly in our tools and on all AR-enabled iPhone and iPad devices.
