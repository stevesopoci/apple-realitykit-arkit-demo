# apple-realitykit-arkit-demo

`AppleRealityKitARKitDemo` is a native **iOS** augmented reality prototype written in **Swift** intended for learning purposes that demonstrates Apple's powerful frameworks like [ARKit](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/arkit/) and [RealityKit](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/realitykit/), and creative tools like [Reality Composer](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/tools/) and [Reality Converter](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/tools/).

[RealityKit](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/realitykit/) gives you more control and customization over the AR experiences you create with native **Swift** APIs and [ARKit](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/arkit/) integration. With additional APIs like **Custom Rendering**, **Metal Shaders**, and **Post Processing**, you have more control over the rendering pipeline and more flexibility to create entirely new worlds in AR. And with the [Object Capture API](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/object-capture/), you can create unique 3D objects that are optimized for AR in minutes using state-of-the-art photogrammetry algorithms.

[Reality Composer](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/tools) is a powerful tool that makes it easy for you to create interactive augmented reality experiences with no prior 3D experience. [Reality Converter](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/tools/) quickly converts your existing 3D models to **USDZ** so it works seamlessly in Apple's tools and on all AR-enabled **iPhone** and **iPad** devices.
